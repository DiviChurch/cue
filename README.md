## Description

Cue gives you the ability to easily create stylish playlists and display them anywhere on your site using a widget, shortcode or template tag. Upload new audio files, reuse existing files in your media library, or even link to remote sources.

* Reorder tracks with a simple drag and drop interface.
* Seamlessly integrates with WordPress' media manager to select audio and images.
* Completely responsive to work on any device that supports your chosen audio format.
* Extends the MediaElement.js script bundled with core.

= AudioTheme Integration =

Cue was originally built for [AudioTheme](https://audiotheme.com/?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=link&utm_term=cue&utm_campaign=readmes), but we wanted everyone to have the ability to easily create beautiful playlists, so we're releasing it free for general use. Additional integration is built into our framework to extend Cue and allow tracks in your discography to be used as sources for playlist tracks.

For an example of how Cue can be extended, check out [CueBar, a jukebox audio player](https://demo.audiotheme.com/cuebar/?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=link&utm_term=cue&utm_campaign=readmes) made for WordPress.

## Installation

[Cue is in the WordPress.org plugin directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cue/) and can be installed directly form within your admin panel.
